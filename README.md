# adventures in vue

Hi there! 👋 We’re taking Vue and Vite out for a test drive, implementing some base functionality and getting a feel for how components work.

## usage

Download the repo and run `npm install`. Just a few dev dependencies. Run `npm run dev` to start a local or `npm run build` to compile the project.
